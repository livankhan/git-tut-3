# Github walkthrough

Trying to figure out Github with this one. Please feel free to ignore it.

**TODO:**

- [x] How to use Git (I already know how to use it, just gonna go a bit deeper)
- [x] Upload files to Github after committing
- [x] Get familiar with the Github UX
- [x] How to upload on Github
- [x] Explore the possibilities
- [x] How to use SSH keys
- [x] `README.md` markup
